# Purpose

This project is an attempt to create a GUI to simplify the task of creating materials for BIRG, a roleplaying game also by Will Zev Prahl. It was created in 2019 by Will Zev Prahl.

## BIRG Components

BIRG uses several components to create characters. The most important are:

 - *Descriptor*s: each character is essentially a package of descriptors, which are m
odular components describing what that character can do. A character's descriptors de
termine their _attribute_s and their _skill_s.
 - *Background*s: each character has a background, which determines which descriptors
 are _expected_, _ordinary_ or _extraordinary_ for that character.

## Project Goals

Some target features:

 - Create and edit descriptors.
 - Create backgrounds and select sets of descriptors to be expected or ordinary.
 - Compare backgrounds' expectations with each other side-by-side.
 - A character-builder application, using existing backgrounds and descriptors.
